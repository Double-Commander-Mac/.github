## 💡 Overview  

**Double Commander** is a versatile, open-source file manager inspired by the classic *Total Commander*. Designed for efficiency and productivity, it provides a dual-pane interface that allows users to manage files and folders with speed and precision.  

The app supports a wide range of file operations — copying, moving, comparing, and synchronizing — all within a powerful, customizable environment. With its cross-platform architecture, **Double Commander** runs natively on macOS, Linux, and Windows, making it a favorite among developers, system administrators, and advanced users.  

It supports ZIP, TAR, and other archive formats as if they were regular folders, enabling quick navigation and manipulation without extraction. Built-in text and hex viewers, file comparison tools, and multi-rename features enhance workflow efficiency.  

The application offers keyboard shortcuts, tabbed browsing, and extensive plugin compatibility. Users can personalize their workspace with color schemes, custom commands, and layout configurations.  

Optimized for macOS — including full Apple Silicon support — **Double Commander** is a reliable, free, and powerful alternative to proprietary file managers, providing total control over your file system.
